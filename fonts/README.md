# Custom fonts directory

Place your .ttf/.otf/.ttc font files here. The app will try to load fonts by the selected family name from this folder first. For example:

- DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf
- DejaVuSans.ttf
- Arial.ttf
- Roboto-Regular.ttf
- Inter-Regular.ttf
- OpenSans-Regular.ttf
- Montserrat-Regular.ttf
- Lato-Regular.ttf

If a selected font is not found here, the app will fall back to common system fonts.
